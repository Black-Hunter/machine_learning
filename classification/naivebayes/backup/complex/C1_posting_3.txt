Rhymed verse in Shakespeare's plays is usually in rhymed couplets, i.e. two successive lines of verse of which the final words rhyme with another.
The rhyme pattern of verse in rhyming couplets is conventionally represented aa bb cc etc., with the letters a, b, and c referring to the rhyming 
sound of the final  word in a line.  (A single rhymed couplet may also appear at the end of a speech or scene in blank verse, in which case it is 
called a capping couplet.)  When the two lines of a rhyming couplet are in iambic pentameter, they are called heroic couplets. Example: Helena's 
lament in A Midsummer Night's Dream (I.i.234-9)
