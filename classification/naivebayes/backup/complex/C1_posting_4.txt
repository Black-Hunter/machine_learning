Blank Verse refers to unrhymed iambic pentameter. Blank verse resembles prose in that the final words of the lines do not rhyme in any regular 
pattern (although an occasional rhyming couplet may be found).  Unlike prose, there is a recognizable meter:  most lines are in iambic pentameter,
i.e. they consist of ten syllables alternating unstressed and stressed syllables (there may be some irregularities, such an occasional troche 
mixed in with the iambs or an extra unstressed syllable at the end of a line).
