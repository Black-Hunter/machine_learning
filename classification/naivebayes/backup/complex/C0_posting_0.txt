An essay can have many purposes, but the basic structure is the same no matter what. You may be writing an essay to argue for a particular point 
of view or to explain the steps necessary to complete a task. 
Either way, your essay will have the same basic format. If you follow a few simple steps, you will find that the essay almost writes itself. You 
will be responsible only for supplying ideas, which are the important part of the essay anyway.
