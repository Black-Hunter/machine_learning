Prose refers to ordinary speech with no regular pattern of accentual rhythm. Lines of text do not all have the same number of syllables nor is 
there any discernible pattern of stresses. If you are unsure if a passage is in prose or in blank verse, look for the following visual clue: a 
long passage in prose is typically printed in your text like an ordinary paragraph with right and left justification.  The lines of print extend 
from left to right margin with no "hard return" in the middle of a sentence. Standard rules of capitalization are followed: only proper nouns 
(names and place names), the pronoun "I" and the first letter of a new sentence are capitalized.
