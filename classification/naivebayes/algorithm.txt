Input: document set(each document is classified, that is, each document is labeled some class)
Steps:
	1. Get the following information during parsing the documents one by one in the document set:
	a) The number of i) total documents and ii) documents by class.
	b) The number of tokens i) in documents of some class and ii) in all documents in the daocument set.
	c) Appearance times of i) some word in documents of some class and 2) some word in all docuemnts in the document set.
	
	2. Calculate p(ci), p(t|ci), p(t) based on the information got in 1.
	p(ci) = (number of documents labeled class 'ci') | (number of all documents in the document set);
	p(t|ci) = (number of appearance times of token 't' in documents of class 'ci') / (number of all tokens in documents of class 'ci');
	p(t) = (appearance times of token 't' in all documents in the document set) / (number of all tokens in all documents in the document set);
	N.B. note here we calculate p(t|ci) and p(t) based on summing the appearance times of token 't' or all tokens in documents of class 'ci' or all
	documents in the document set, this is called 'bag-of-words document model'. In some cases, we treat the appearance of token 't' in one 
	docuement as one time no matter how many times of the appearance of the token in the document, this is called 'set-of-words document model'.

	3. Claculate p(ci|t) using Bayes rule:
	p(ci|t) = p(t|ci)*p(ci)/p(t);

	4. Predict which class that each document in the test set belongs to.
	For each document 'doc' in the test set, the probability that it belongs to class 'ci' is: p(doc|ci) = p(t1|ci)*...p(tn|ci), t1...tn are tokens
	in document 'doc'. Then choose the class 'ck' with the maximum probability as the prediction.

Output:
	Error rate of the prediction of classification of documents in the test set.
